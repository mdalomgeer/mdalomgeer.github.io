## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Headshot.jpg">

My name is Md Alomgeer Hussein. I am a PhD student in the Information Systems department at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My research focuses on natural language processing and human computer interaction, with an emphasis on health-related applications. I study how people interact with AI systems in sensitive, high-stakes contexts such as healthcare, and how language-driven systems shape understanding, trust, and decision making. I earned my BSc and MSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. This training built my foundation in analytical thinking, systems design, and quantitative methods. I also earned a second master’s degree in Information Systems from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2024.
