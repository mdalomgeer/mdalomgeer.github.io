## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Headshot.jpg">

I am a PhD student in Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, working on applied AI research at the intersection of NLP, HCI, and healthcare. I build and evaluate large language model–based systems for real-world health applications, with an emphasis on safety, clarity, and user trust. My work includes LLM evaluation, agent-based workflows, and human-centered assessment of AI outputs in high-risk domains. I bring a strong engineering foundation from my BSc and MSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Dhaka, along with advanced training in Information Systems from UMBC, where I earned a second master's degree in 2024. I enjoy translating research ideas into robust, measurable systems grounded in real user needs.

My CV is [here](/Resume-Alomgeer.pdf) (Last update: Dec 2025).

## Research Interest

I am trained as a health informatics researcher working at the intersection of computational methods and patient-centered applications. My research integrates methodological and empirical inquiry, with a focus on language-driven AI systems in healthcare.

**[1] Methodological:** Advancing informatics and computational methods for analyzing and integrating heterogeneous health data. This includes large language models, LLMs as a Judge for systematic evaluation, agentic AI pipelines, and explainable approaches for assessing safety, quality, and alignment in health-related AI systems;

**[2] Empirical:** Applying data-driven methods to generate empirical evidence that informs clinical practice, patient care, and population health. My work evaluates AI-generated health information for readability, trust, emotional support, and decision support, with comparisons to human-generated content in real-world settings;

**[3] Translational:** Designing, implementing, and evaluating health information technologies and digital interventions that support health knowledge, patient self-management, and coordination among patients, clinicians, and healthcare stakeholders.
