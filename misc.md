## Misc

Outside of work, I spend time on activities that help me stay active, curious, and socially engaged. I enjoy playing football and cricket, running, cycling, watching films, and reading.

Reading is a consistent part of my routine. My interests include history, fiction, historical fiction, detective fiction, and public sociology. I keep a yearly list of books I enjoyed. The list reflects personal interests rather than formal evaluation and helps me track how my reading evolves over time.
