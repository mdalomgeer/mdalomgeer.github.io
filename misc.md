## Misc

Outside of my academic work, I value creative and physical activities that help me reset and stay grounded.

I enjoy top rope climbing, running, knitting, crocheting, and urban sketching. These practices help me balance analytical work with hands-on creativity.

One long-term personal goal is to open a small knitting studio. I want it to be a shared space where people learn to knit, work together, exchange patterns, and build community through making.

Reading plays a central role in my life. My interests lean toward history, fiction, historical fiction, detective fiction, and public sociology. I keep a yearly list of books I enjoyed. The list reflects personal taste rather than any formal ranking.

### Books I enjoyed

These books align with classic literature, psychological depth, moral inquiry, history, and intellectually driven thrillers.
