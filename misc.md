## Misc

Outside of work, I enjoy:

🧗🏼‍♀️ Top rope climbing

🧶 Knitting and crocheting

🏃🏻‍♀️ Running

🖋️ Urban sketching

📖 Reading

One of my life goals is to open a small knitting studio, where people can learn how to knitt, knit together, and share knitting patterns.

I like reading, especially on history, fiction (historical fiction and detective fiction particularly), and public sociology. I try to maintain a list of the books I liked every year. It is a highly subjective and personal list.
