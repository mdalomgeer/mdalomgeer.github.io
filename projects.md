## Projects

**QnA: An LLM-Powered Conversational Agent (CA) for Supporting Colorectal Cancer Knowledge**  
*Fall 2024*

• Fine-tuning the Meta LLaMA-2 7B Chat HF model to develop a conversational agent that provides accurate, empathetic, and accessible answers about colorectal cancer, improving health literacy for underserved communities.

• Utilizing a dataset of over 1,000,000 posts and comments from online health communities, employing 4-bit quantization and LoRA fine-tuning to optimize computational efficiency and adapt the model to domain-specific challenges.

**From Data to Topography: A Deep Learning Approach to Predict Ice Bed**  
*Spring 2023*

• Designed a deep learning model with dense and LSTM layers to predict Greenland's ice bed topography, addressing sparse satellite data by utilizing surface features.

• Achieved promising results compared to traditional machine learning models in accurately estimating the ice bed map.

**Exploring Causality between Arctic Sea Ice and Climate Variability Using Advanced Time Series Analysis**  
*Spring 2023*

• Applied advanced causal discovery techniques, including DC, CIV, Variable-lag Granger Causality, and Transfer Entropy, to explore linkages between sea ice extent and climate variables.

• Used causal inference models to quantify the impact of different causal relationships on the Arctic system, highlighting key drivers of sea ice changes.

**Detecting Fraudulent Job Postings Using NLP and Machine Learning**  
*Fall 2022*

• Developed an NLP-based classifier to distinguish between real and fake job postings, utilizing the Kaggle dataset of 17,880 job descriptions.

• Employed machine learning algorithms, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine, to enhance the detection of deceptive job ads and improve job market safety.
